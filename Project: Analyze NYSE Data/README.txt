# ANALYZE NYSE Data

In this project, I worked with a New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) dataset that contains fundamental financial data for 500 companies. The key findings were communicated in a professional manner. Designed a dashboard that calculates the financial metrics and auto populates the income statement for each company using data validation and advanced lookup tools within Excel. Then financial metrics forecasted within the Income Statement, based on three scenarios with distinct assumptions for a company from the NYSE dataset.

Worked with real-world data that has missing and incorrect values;
