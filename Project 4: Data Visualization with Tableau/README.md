## Project: Build Data Dashboards

Sharing insights is an integral part of working with data. In this project,  interactive dashboards were created with Tableau to tell stories from data. There is a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize the quality of airlines and airports, find the best times to fly, and more. These types of visualizations help guide decision making to reach the best outcomes.

### Summary: 

 - Selected the most appropriate data visualization for an analysis;
 - Evaluated the effectiveness of a data visualization;
 - Built interactive and engaging Tableau dashboards;
