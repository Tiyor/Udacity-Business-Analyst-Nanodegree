**DESCRIPTION:**

It can be seen that Texas has the highest flight cancellation rate (668) while West Virginia (3) and Montana (3) had the lowest rate. National Air system is one of the major causes for flight cancellations and New York and New Jersey were on the 2nd  and 3rd  places in this regard. Illinois has the harsh climate and it caused 330 flight cancellations which was 2nd  highest rate in 2015.

Tree map was chosen to visually represent this data as it clearly shows the highest and lowest rates in better picture.

**DESCRIPTION:**

In this chart, it is shown the number of reasons for flight delays in 2015.  In overall, departure delays were the highest in this category with 2,649,459 whereas security delays only caused 4,702 flight delays.

Bar chart was used to present this data as it makes easy for readers to understand the data. Different colors weren’t used because it may distract the reader.

**DESCRIPTION:**

This chart represents arrival delays by airlines and tried to answer of the following question: “Does the farthest distance make the arrival delays?”. Southwest had the farthest distance (43,873,973) and the most arrival delays (289,992). On the other hand, Alaska had further distance than several airlines had but there were no arrival delays.

In nutshell, the farthest distance is not the main cause for the arrival delays.
